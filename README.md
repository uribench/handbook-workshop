# Workshop Version of the Software Engineering Handbook

This is a *minimalist version* of the [software-engineering-handbook][1] GitHub repository.
It is intended for experimenting with the various steps involved with content contribution during 
the hands-on workshop.

During the workshop you will be viewing from time to time **two different versions** of the handbook 
for the workshop. One is the **last approved** version of the [handbook for the workshop][2]. The 
other is a temporary **pull request preview** version. The later will be launched automatically when 
a new pull request is created. It is useful for reviewing the proposed changes before approving 
them. The pull request preview version is prepared by an open-source tool called **madness**.

To easily distinguish between these two sites and avoid confusion, look for any of the following 
signs:

- You are on the **last approved** version if:
    - The URL used by the browser starts with `http://workshop.software-engineering-handbook.com`
    - There is **no left side panel with search option** as in the below image.
- You are on the **pull request preview** version if:
    - The URL is in the form `handbook-workshop-<unique-id>.now.sh`
    - There is a **left side panel with search option** as in the below image.

The **left side panel** with the search option for previewing the pull request looks like:

When using the **pull request preview** version you can use the search option and the links on the 
left panel to preview the [Handbook](/Handbook) with the proposed changes that were not confirmed
yet.
